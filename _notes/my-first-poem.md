Here is my version of Colors:
Sample Line Break 

<div class="poetry">
Colours

I dream of you,  
In colours,  
That don't,  
Exist.  

Paradise  

Between the red kiss  
of your lips,  
And the blue sky  
in your eyes,  
I am in paradise.   

Whenever I see pink,
I see blue,
I think maybe it's because 
Pink reminds me of you,
And lately all I have felt,
With you,
Is blue. 

Cold mellow unloving blue. 
So now when I look at your rosy cheeks,
I'm always thinking about how
my eyes somehow alter the tones
to an icy and cold exterior
Or the feeling of pink that used
To wash over me
is now just blue rain,
Going away when you're gone,
only to return again. 

And I think about leaving you,
I do,
But the blue shade I have being seeing in you,
Is a pretty shade too. 

No matter what I do,
I am entrapped in the pink,
Or blue,
And I miss seeing pink,
But I'll just have to get used to,
This version of you.
