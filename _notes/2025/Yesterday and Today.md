### Context

Has adulting ever hit you like an urgent deadline?

Has it ever felt strange how you are the age you used to consider "mature" and "grown up"? Because most of us are just floundering away and then you look around yourself (especially in places where you've grown up) and see how many things have changed. Which only adds a flavour of nostalgia and reminiscence into the cauldron of adulting.

Anyway... the next one is about this feeling...

<div class="poetry">

The trees that we plucked flowers from, 
have grown twice its size.
My six-year old self, 
wouldn't have believed its rise.

Would the kids on the swing, 
believe if I told them, 
I was in their place, 
before the swings were stemmed?

The infants I had held, 
are just as tall as me now.
I can't believe that so much time, 
has come to pass somehow.

Just yesterday I was a child, 
recklessly running at play.
Wishing to get older,
Oblivious to the challenges at bay.

Just yesterday I was younger, 
and today I find it strange, 
that I looked away for a moment, 
and somehow everything has changed.
