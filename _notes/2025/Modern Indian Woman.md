### Context

I'm back with another rant of a poem. The next one comes from the anger of having supposed "privilege" of having it easy than women few generations ago. But have things really changed?

Aren't "modern" women still subjected to the "traditional" expectations? Like the scene from one of my favourite movies

"Dil Dhadakne Do" where a character says _"Maine allow kiya Aisha ko kaam karne ke liye"_. Such subtle power play based on gender are more common than we can acknowledge. What's sadder is how most women have internalized these misogynist patterns without realizing it.

Now now now. I know this topic is extremely nuanced and not everyone sees it in the same way. Please take it with a pinch salt.

Cheers to all the "Modern Indian Women"


<div class="poetry">

I'm a modern Indian woman,
"Free" and "bold",
Would my Nani have imagined,
The facets of modernity I'd uphold?

I'd be a modern Indian woman,
Well taught and learned,
"I work and work and work",
Until a place at men's table is earned.

I'm a modern Indian woman,
"I can make jam now, look",
Cause what even is a wife's earning,
If she can't cook.

I'm a modern Indian woman,
"Be ambitious but only realistically,
Because all that work and no wedding,
Will make you an outlaw, statistically."

I'm a modern Indian woman,
I don't feign rage,
I smile and ask for an escort at night,
God forbid I'm without one even at my grown age.

I'm a modern Indian woman,
Who, I'm sure, my Nani would've pitied,
Another generation of woman,
Made modern by society's deceit.
