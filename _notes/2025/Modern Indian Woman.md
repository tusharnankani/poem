<div class="poetry">

I'm a modern Indian woman,
"Free" and "bold",
Would my Nani have imagined,
The facets of modernity I'd uphold?

I'd be a modern Indian woman,
Well taught and learned,
"I work and work and work",
Until a place at men's table is earned.

I'm a modern Indian woman,
"I can make jam now, look",
Cause what even is a wife's earning,
If she can't cook.

I'm a modern Indian woman,
"Be ambitious but only realistically,
Because all that work and no wedding,
Will make you an outlaw, statistically."

I'm a modern Indian woman,
I don't feign rage,
I smile and ask for an escort at night,
God forbid I'm without one even at my grown age.

I'm a modern Indian woman,
Who, I'm sure, my Nani would've pitied,
Another generation of woman,
Made modern by society's deceit.
