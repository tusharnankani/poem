### Context

The next one comes straight from the break up archives.

You know how when you love someone, you just can't wish anything bad for them. But you are also breaking up with them! So you curse them, yell at them, become a tiny maniac! Say and do anything that makes your pain feel heard by this person.

I hope the next one sticks to the exes like a curse.

<div class="poetry">

I hope you feel love, 
So deep,
She becomes your air,
Without her,
You can't breathe.

I hope you feel love, 
So fierce,
You build walls, 
To protect it,
That no one can pierce.

I hope you feel love, 
So endearing,
You faithless soul,
Becomes, 
Fate fearing.

I hope you feel love, 
So devoted,
You feel days are too much, 
For her, 
To be courted

I hope you feel love, 
So addicting,
Even a day without her, 
Feels wrath of Hades, 
Afflicting.

I hope you feel love, 
So true,
Every memory of mine, 
of Us,
Fades to blue.

I hope you feel love, 
I really do,
Because then,
You'll have something, 
You'll be scared to lose.

I hope you feel love, 
So you feel the fear, 
A fractured fraction, 
Of what I'm feeling,
As I'm losing someone dear.
