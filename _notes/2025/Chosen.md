### Context

Chosen? I haven't chosen you. I was pulled towards you, helplessly and effortlessly. Like the rain reaches the earth, I reach you.

<div class="poetry">

A tiny speck of water,
Floats in the sky.
If she became smaller,
She could reach the heavens high.

But no, she becomes rain,
To meet the earth.
Maybe her love for Earth,
Holds more worth.

Then what's a god, 
Beside a lover,
What does heaven have,
That the earth don't cover.

So why go to,
Some promised land,
When I can reach,
Your parched sand.
