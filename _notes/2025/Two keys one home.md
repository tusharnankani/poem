### Context

Living vicariously through lovers is beautiful. All of us guilty of imagining grand romantic gestures. But I wonder about the intimacy of being mundane with someone. 

The next one imagines the same normality of lives of two people through dialogues exchanged between them.

<div class="poetry">

Two keys, one home, 
"I can't find mine,
I'm using your comb."

Two playlists, one car,
"Can I play my song?
My office isn't far."

Two jobs, one rant,
"Why is adulting so tough?
I just can't!"

Two spoons, one plate,
"You're eating from my side again"
The same old debate.

Two chores, one toss,
or do e, ways est the dishes

Two pillows, one sheet, 
Whispers in darkness,
"Another day's complete."
