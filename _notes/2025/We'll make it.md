### Context

Often I rollback to think about times where I absolutely felt like giving up. A lot of times, I did. But the rest, I pulled through. Through the mess of trying, through the self doubt of failing, through the longing of having done it earlier or better. I wish I could tell my past self that I'm grateful, proud and happy for trying and making it through.

For someone who takes the song "You're on your own, kid" as an anthem, it's a reminder that you're not quite on your own. You have you. I wish I could say the next one to my past vulnerable self.

PS. My absolute best to anyone who is trying... anything new, scary, difficult.. or maybe just trying to get by. Please be kind to your mind.

<div class="poetry">

You're not on your own, 
you have me by your side.
No matter what happens, 
I'm proud you tried.

You are diligent and relentless.
Yes! You can do it.
This is character development.
We are building your grit.

Know that it's alright,
If you haven't found yourself yet.
But, you will someday.
Just don't you fret.

Success is a few tries away, 
don't you give up now.
You have me by your side,
We'll make it... someday... somehow...
