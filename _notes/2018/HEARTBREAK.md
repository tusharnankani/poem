Heartbreak is like a part of love, especially teenage love. It is something you are bound to feel if u fall in love. It hurts. But that's the price we have to pay in order to get love.

In Greek mythology, it is believed that a human has two parts. But together they were too powerful and could have caused problems to the Gods. So the Gods decided to divide humans. And let both the parts search to be whole again. All of us are still in search of our other half.

Sometimes we meet people, whom we think, might be our other half. We trust them with our hearts and souls. But later we find out that our belief was wrong.

In teenage years, heartbreaks are more abundant. But I think, heartbreaks are important so that when the true love, the other half comes about they can hug you so thing that all the pieces once broken stick back together.( Their love can mend you and your brokenness and join the pieces together that were once shattered by a wrong choice) That would be the power of true love. The essence of being whole again.
