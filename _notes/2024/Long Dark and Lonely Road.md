### Context

As a woman, I keep romanticising my life. How beautiful it is living alone.

The freedom can barely be described in words. And as I keep learning to walk by myself, I grow to appreciate this life I have a little bit more.

But after an unfortunate, unforseen incident, I'm realising how difficult it is just barely walking alone by myself.

When I flip the coin, the other side of freedom is loneliness, fear and insecurity.

It's a long, dark and lonely road to overcome it all now.

<div class="poetry">

No, it doesn't feel easy, 
Walking on that road now.
Looking at all the bikes, 
With a suspicious brow.

When headlights flash,
I'm there in that moment again.
Walking that daily walk, 
Which I thought was mundane.

Then in a flash it wasn't anymore, 
Did they hit or did they grope, 
Screaming, crying, confused, scared,
Clueless on the ways to cope.


"It happens to all women",
"Be more careful, you'll be fine" 
My pain and anger was forgotten, 
Blurred by several of those lines.

It wasn't my fault,
So it shouldn't be difficult right?
But I can't easily walk by bikes, 
Or on that path or a place with no lights.
