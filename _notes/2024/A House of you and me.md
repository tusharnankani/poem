### Context

Wouldn't it be beautiful to live your life with the person you love?

How precious will each mundane thing be? I'm sure you won't think about how lucky you are everyday. 

But then some day a few years down the line you will just think looking at your person â€” "Wow, I'm so lucky". The next one is about hoping for such a day. 

My imagination runs wild when I think of the person and the life I could have with them. I hope fragments of my thoughts reminds you of your person. I hope you're filled with warmth as you read it just as I was when I wrote it. 

I hope things work out for you.


<div class="poetry">

We will live in a house, 
Where the sun lights up our room, 
The air wafts the scent of flowers, 
That, for the third time, are in bloom.

I will turn to you and think,
"How did we make it so far?", 
Then we dress each other for work, 
And hold hands while we drive in a car.

I will be the home that you come to, 
The one that you hold tight against your chest, 
We'll hold each other's tired bodies, 
Like two seasick sailors after a quest.

I'll talk about my day,
Or songs or the poem that I wrote, 
And you'll listen to each word I say, 
And the beauty of every rhyme and every note.

You will quiet my thoughts, 
With the touch of your hands.
We will be, till your fingers are tangled, 
In my wavy hair strands.

I will just look at you and think
"Life is so beautiful with you in it."
As we lay in silence of our love, 
In our bedroom barely lit.

You will then tell me about your secrets,
The secrets only I keep, 
I will listen to your voice and to your silence, 
Then I will watch you fall asleep.

Just like that a day will pass by, 
And it'll become years before you see,
As we keep living in a house, 
Of you and me.
