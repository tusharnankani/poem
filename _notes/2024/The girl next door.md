I'm sure you would've noticed the house in front of ours. It is empty now but earlier there used to live a family of four. Father, mother and two girls. The elder one - Laiba was two years older than me and the younger one - Mantasha was too young. I think five maybe six years younger than me. Their family was the definition of dysfunctional. The father would smoke and drink. Every evening he would come home drunk and hit his wife (or so I have heard). He always wanted a son. He despised his daughters. One time all the neighbours had gathered at our house. He pleaded with our neighbor and said, "Aunty isko bolo na mujhe ladka de." I knew the elder daughter had a tough time at home. She was always scared to stay late to play. If her sister got hurt she would start crying because she knew it would be pinned as her irresponsibility. She was always good at studies. She was soft-spoken and kind. I never saw her argue with any other kid, or throw a tantrum. 

One day a friend of mine - Neha and I were sitting on the swing and talking. That is how we spent a lot of our evenings. I think I was in 6th grade at best. Neha would've been in 8th. We would talk about school, friends, periods? I don't remember so much. But on that day, a group of younger kids were playing and we heard a kid crying. We understood someone had either fallen or a fight had broken out. We rushed to see and found out that it was Mantasha who had fallen down and scratched her knees. We took her to her relatives house who lived on the ground floor. That's when Laiba appeared out of nowhere. She peered at her sister and started crying. She knew it was going to get pinned on her. Everyone consoled her saying it wasn't a serious wound and that both of them would be alright. 

Later Neha and I returned to talking and we were discussing how afraid Laiba is to be in her own house. We thought that if the same treatment continued, Laiba would probably never want to see her parents when she grew older. Why would one return to the place of their traumas? 

I realized today, when I recalled that conversation that whatever I wished for Liaba then, I wish for myself now. I wish never to return home. 

Also, some time later the father started having health complications due to excessive drinking and smoking. He died shortly after. The rest of the family moved out later. Since then, the house has been locked. No tenants, no owner. Just empty.
