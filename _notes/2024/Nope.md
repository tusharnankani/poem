<div class="poetry">

You string all these words,
But none make sense to me,
Your love holds me tight,
'Til I can't breathe.
You give your all,
You make me smile,
You're the best man,
I have met in a while.
You wash my shore,
With gentle salt breeze.
But I'm not a sailor,
Of a calm still sea.
Hands on hands
Your touch so divine
Give me the rush
Like whiskey or wine
Everything is perfect
But not quite right
Everytime I say so
You find me impolite
You made us dance
On these failing rhythms
Blind to see us scattering
Through these prisms
We need to stop
You must let go
The nights get darker
With the sinking moon's glow
No matter how long we dance
In this nightly incandescence
Your love for me
Would never make sense
