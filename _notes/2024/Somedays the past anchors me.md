<div class="poetry">

Finally
Somedays the past anchors me down,
Other days its love tied around.
Sometimes an invisible chain of no feelings at all,
Hiding from sight and building walls.
Locking rooms with my loneliness,
Just to feel home only once.
I love stargazing on the darkest nights,
Knowing they died away burning bright.
I'm all just fine but I don't like me so,
Thinking I'm flying when I'm falling below.
For days just wishing to be on the other side,
Not anchored and drowned by the tides.
Not tied or chained but balanced fine.
Not building walls around stifling signs.
Making room for all that comes.
Waiting and watching what my chaos becomes.
On the scales of black and white, I've settled for gray.
After long long nights, it's finally day.
Now that I've made peace with me,
I know that I've finally set myself free.
