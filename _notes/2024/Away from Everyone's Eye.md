### Context

This poem comes from a person who feels like happiness is fragile. The moment you put it out there, the moment you express it, there will be people who will come to attack you for it.

Similarly, for their relationships too, some people just don't want to sabotage it. And therefore, they become very protective almost superstitious about their relationship. I think this poem is about the fear of losing something real with someone great because of some external variable that both of them can't control but can be influenced by. I don't know how much of it makes sense.

<div class="poetry">


If seas could keep us away, 
I'm sure our haters would come, 
with their shovels and pitchers,
"We're building a sea" as they beat their drums.

If secrets get lost in the knowing, 
then its ignorance is my bliss.
No other soul would know about us, 
our secret rendezvous or our secret kiss.

If I told my well-wishing friends, 
a little bit of something about us, 
I'm sure they'll come with their pitchforks, 
and convince me it's a trend of my lust.

So I'll keep you like a sacred secret, 
and there won't escape a sigh, 
and I'd build bridges across seas, 
but away from everyone's eye.
