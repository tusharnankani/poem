<div class="poetry">

I wish forever,
For us is a little more,
I like to say your name,
Only because it is yours,

I can still feel your hands,
When you touched me so,
I remember your body,
And it's iridescent glow.

Sacred prayers, rituals,
A religion born on my bed,
Darling, you know that,
We're already married in my head.

When you keep saying,
I look like your wife,
I feel warm enough,
To put down my knife.

All of you is,
Always on my mind.
You're better than the best,
My mind could've divined.

For you, I'm learning,
How to be gentle,
That's the way I plot,
So love looks providential.

One year down the line,
It might look like maybe,
But five years from today,
I'll have your baby.

You are my today,
And my tomorrow,
Through age and years,
Through smile and sorrow.

To ever lose you,
Would mean to lose me too.
There's no moving on,
From a love like you.

Where were you,
All my heartbreaks before?
Now I wish our forever,
Is for ever and evermore.
