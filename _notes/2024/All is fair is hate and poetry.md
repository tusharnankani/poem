<div class="poetry">

I grew up to be a thorny bush,
No roses bloomed.
I remained a vile lass,
No, I couldn't be groomed.

They all came in,
With belts, halters and noose,
I remained wild,
Disappointed them; Ran loose.

A shiny toy from afar,
But do not get your hopes high.
When the key is wound,
I make no sound or sigh.

I was almost perfect,
And now a perfect almost.
So what's the point of me anyway,
If I cant be a thing they boast?

They all like roses,
And a smiling lovely wench,
Not a broken toy,
With her soul six feet in a trench.
