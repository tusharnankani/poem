Anxiety

<div class="poetry">

My body is still
But my bones shake from within.
My mind is broken
Under my unbroken skin

I am only plodding through
So how is time running fast
Life is supposed to be serene
But it's somehow aghast

There is so much to do
And I'm falling behind
So to cope I believe
It's all in my mind 

</div>

### Context

This is from the time I was prepping for GRE for the second time. I don't think I've had anxiety like I did during that time.
