Flower with Thorns
Wishing for dainty flowers
I sow the so-so seeds
They see not who you are
They probe your past deeds
I water them not knowing
Of what they'll become
They may see you cry
Not the pain to which you succumb
I grow a green bush
With prickles and spikes
You grow cold in snow
In blizzard of desolated dislikes
But the green bush
Has roses to bloom
Your light can make
Smiles in gloom
I see you now
Strong and lovelorn
Realising you were but
A flower with thorns
