<div class="poetry">

Sea touches the sand,
With its eb and flow,
Their love is the tide,
That comes and goes.
Sun burns for the moon,
Moon sings to its sweet,
They love from distance,
Cursed to never meet.
Love is a bane.
Love is a boon.
You can be the sea.
You can be the moon.
I'll be your sand,
When things go wrong,
Or be your sun,
To listen to your song.
