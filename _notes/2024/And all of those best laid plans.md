title: And all of those best laid plans

<div class="poetry">

I saw Auroras in pictures,
And wondered if we'd see them someday.
But then I asked, "How was today?"
And learned you've seen them anyway.

I hear you can go to that concert,
We hoped to go to together.
I'm just jealous that those hopes,
Were washed away by the weather.

I guess you're still planning,
That picturesque Europe road trip.
Guess now you speak for one,
When you recite you're carefully sewed script.

I wonder if you still want,
That gorgeous cottage-core church wedding.
I guess it's with someone else now.
I'd be happy for you, but thinking about it is upsetting.

All the plans I laid with care,
Have disgracefully come undone,
I still hold on to them,
But I wish I could let them go one by one.
