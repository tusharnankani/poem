<div class="poetry">

To my dearest,
You touch my heart
But not like lovers do
You make me smile
With a joke or two
You listen to me
And about my day
I know I won't
But I hope I'd stay
Even if I do
We'll run out of time
So to keep you here
I string this rhyme
Something to look upon
When we drift apart
Reminding me
How you touched my heart
