<div class="poetry">

NOW I KEEP,
OUR PICTURES IN A FOLDER.
AND I CAN SEE HOW
I'M GETTING OLD BUT,
YOU'RE GETTING OLDER.

I MISS HOW EVERYTIME I CRIED,
I HAD YOUR SHOULDER.
NOW THAT YOU'RE AWAY,
I CAN FEEL HOW,
I'M GETTING OLD,
BUT YOU'RE GETTING OLDER.

YEARS MAKE ME UGLY,
AND MY HEART COLDER,
BUT THERE'S A SEARING REALISATION,
THAT IF I'M GETTING OLD,
YOU'RE GETTING OLDER.

TIME WON'T STOP,
AND I CAN'T HOLD HER.
OH BUT HOW I WISH,
EVEN IF I'M GETTING GETTING OLD,
YOU'RE WEREN'T GETTING OLDER...
