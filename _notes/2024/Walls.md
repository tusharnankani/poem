<div class="poetry">

I've built all these walls
Too high to climb
It's dark and lonely
Almost like death inside
I've chipped all my nails
When I clawed these walls
I lose to myself
In all my rubbish brawls
I screamed so loud
I lost my voice
The wall stood menacingly
With all its poise
All these punches
Broke my bones
The walls are closing in
To my darkest zones
It's my choice
To walk down the ledge
But I think it's the walls
That push me off the edge
And I keep falling
Thinking I'm too broken
Though doors were never closed
But never really opened
