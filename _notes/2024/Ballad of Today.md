<div class="poetry">

Here I am again today,
Sipping coffee with no sugar.
Remembered the first day we met,
When you called me out for being a looker.

Here I am again today,
Listening to songs too loud for me.
Remembered the day we talked along,
Standing in the sun by the sea.

Here I am again today,
Reading our age old conversations,
Remembering the day we almost fought,
Recalling even our bleakest confrontation.

Here I am again today,
Weeping by your grave.
Remembered the day you told me to love again,
But I have already spent all that I saved.

Here I am again today,
Doing the things you loved to do,
Holding these shards my hands run red,
Holding pieces of me that are stained with you.
