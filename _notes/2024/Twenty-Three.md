<div class="poetry">

Years ago we were twenty-two,
When some miracle made you befriend me,
It was supposed to last a lifetime,
But a decade later, you're still twenty-three.

You told me about your job,
How in two years you'll be free,
But those two years never passed,
Because you never got past twenty-three.

Arm-in-arm we foresaw a life,
Our own house, a car, a suburban dream.
We'd grow old together, we thought,
But the premonition failed at twenty-three.

I have a wife, and two kids too.
I would've introduced you over tea.
You would've loved them I know,
But you made different plans at twenty-three.

It's your birthday today,
You would've turned thirty-three.
I too would've had a different life,
If you wouldn't have died at twenty-three.
