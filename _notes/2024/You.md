<div class="poetry">

I don't even know,
What I would do,
Cause everything good in me,
Comes through you.

You're my guiding star,
The anchor to my ship.
The one who gets me,
When I'm losing my grip.

I didn't even know,
What love could be.
Until I set my sails,
To your sea.

All of my hope,
And all of my peace,
Comes to life,
When our distances cease.

I know this is real.
It has to be.
Cause a life without you,
Can't pass by me.

I can't even think,
What I would do,
If I had to live a life 
With no you.
