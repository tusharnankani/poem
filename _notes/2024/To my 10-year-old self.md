<div class="poetry">

Oh, look at you
So young and fragile
And look at me
So old and agile.
Oh, look at you
So innocent and pure
And look at me
Too worldly and sure.
So, I’ll tell you a word or two
Just keep them in your heart
For they may hold you up
When you’re falling apart.
Some people will stay
Some people will leave.
They will make you tough
They will make you believe.
They may give you smiles
They may give you pain.
You’ll have some losses
But you’ll earn some gains.
Be grateful to the angels
But not the marshy men
Cause if they let you down once
They might as well do it again.
Often good is very little
And evil everywhere
But a deal with the devil
Would be an illicit affair.
There will be times
When life will seem farse
You might be alone
Or a hope too sparse
That is okay
You will be just fine.
To make you strong
Is probably the cosmic design.
You will be judged
On what you speak.
You will be judged
When you are weak.
You will be judged
On your choice of men.
You will be judged
On the words of your pen.
But you too are doubly edged
Good and evil both conjoint.
You aren’t just any one
But side of the same coin.
Your soul is fire
And your heart is ice
And fates turn faces
Like a rolling dice.
Have yourself as you are
And fates will turn your way
Life won’t be a fairyland
But a good place to stay.
So, who am I?
You may sit and ponder
Just know that
I am you but stronger.
