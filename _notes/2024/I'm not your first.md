### Context

The next one is about the feeling you have when you know you're not the first love and you won't be the last of a person you love. You are the one in between. You're a phase that your partner may not give much thought to.

The one they will likely want to forget after they settle.
If you're familiar with this feeling I hope the infinite love you give and deserve.


<div class="poetry">

The one in between
I'm not your first,
I'm sure I ain't your last,
So I'm sure there are no impressions,
On your heart that I cast.

I'm not the start,
And I'm not the end ,
So your actions don't matter,
I know you won't repent.

I'm in between "The one",
And the "I wish it was her",
So all I do for you,
Will eventually wash to a blur.

I'm just one of the many,
"Yeah that was a crazy phase".
One of the many histories,
That you will try to erase.

So I doubt you will cherish,
And I doubt you will regret,
I will simply be the one,
That you will just forget.
